# diabetes-ml-prediction
Diabetes prediction using supervised machine learning

#Project Overview
This project is a practical implementation of the research paper titled:
"Supervised Machine Learning based Ensemble Model for Accurate Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes" which is published on ResearchGate.

The goal is to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using supervised machine learning techniques applied to a health dataset. This serves as a hands-on application of ML 
techniques in healthcare analytics.

---
- Loads and preprocesses a diabetes dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains multiple supervised learning models
- Evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report
- Compares model performance and highlights the best-performing algorithm
- Demonstrates real-world application of machine learning in healthcare
- Offers a reproducible project based on academic research
- Shows performance comparison across multiple ML models for decision-making
